## EOS Online Subsystem C++ Example for Unreal Engine 5.0

This is the C++ example project for Unreal Engine 5.0. It demonstrates how to use [the EOS Online Subsystem plugin](https://redpointgames.gitlab.io/eos-online-subsystem/) in your Unreal Engine project.

### Getting started

To use this example project, you'll need to install the EOS Online Subsystem plugin. You can do this in a number of ways:

- Install the Marketplace Edition through the Epic Games Launcher. This will install the plugin system-wide, so you don't need to add files to the example project to get it working.
- Install the Free Edition after downloading it, and add the Free Edition underneath the `Plugins/` folder (as outlined [in the documentation](https://redpointgames.gitlab.io/eos-online-subsystem/docs/#installing-the-plugin)).
- Install the Marketplace Edition from the source code repository, and add it underneath the `Plugins/` folder (as outlined [in the documentation](https://redpointgames.gitlab.io/eos-online-subsystem/docs/#installing-the-plugin)).

### Getting started

This example project requires at least EOS Online Subsystem 2021.07.06. Please make sure you have the latest version installed through the Epic Games Launcher, or the example project won't work.

### Configure EOS

You will need to configure the EOS plugin with your own organisation, sandbox, product and client IDs, as outlined in [the documentation](https://redpointgames.gitlab.io/eos-online-subsystem/docs/core_configuration).

Once you've replaced the existing values with your own, you should be able to run the example project in the editor.
